# Tracker tools (\`tracker\_\*\`)

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

The `tracker_*` tools allow the Gemini agent to maintain an internal, persistent
graph of tasks and dependencies for multi-step requests. This suite of tools
provides a more robust and granular way to manage execution plans than the
legacy `write_todos` tool.

## Technical reference

[Section titled “Technical reference”](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/tracker/#technical-reference)

The agent uses these tools to manage its execution plan, decompose complex goals
into actionable sub-tasks, and provide real-time progress updates to the CLI
interface. The task state is stored in the `.gemini/tmp/tracker/<session-id>`
directory, allowing the agent to manage its plan for the current session.

### Available Tools

[Section titled “Available Tools”](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/tracker/#available-tools)

- `tracker_create_task`: Creates a new task in the tracker. You can specify a
title, description, and task type (`epic`, `task`, `bug`).
- `tracker_update_task`: Updates an existing task’s status (`open`,
`in_progress`, `blocked`, `closed`), description, or dependencies.
- `tracker_get_task`: Retrieves the full details of a specific task by its
6-character hex ID.
- `tracker_list_tasks`: Lists tasks in the tracker, optionally filtered by
status, type, or parent ID.
- `tracker_add_dependency`: Adds a dependency between two tasks, ensuring
topological execution.
- `tracker_visualize`: Renders an ASCII tree visualization of the current task
graph.

## Technical behavior

[Section titled “Technical behavior”](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/tracker/#technical-behavior)

- **Interface:** Updates the progress indicator and task tree above the CLI
input prompt.
- **Persistence:** Task state is saved automatically to the
`.gemini/tmp/tracker/<session-id>` directory. Task states are session-specific
and do not persist across different sessions.
- **Dependencies:** Tasks can depend on other tasks, forming a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). The agent must resolve dependencies before starting blocked
tasks.
- **Interaction:** Users can view the current state of the tracker by asking the
agent to visualize it, or by running `gemini-cli` commands if implemented.

## Use cases

[Section titled “Use cases”](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/tracker/#use-cases)

- Coordinating multi-file refactoring projects.
- Breaking down a mission into a hierarchy of epics and tasks for better
visibility.
- Tracking bugs and feature requests directly within the context of an active
codebase.
- Providing visibility into the agent’s current focus and remaining work.
