# Agent Skill best practices

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Create high-quality, reliable Agent Skills by following these established design
principles and patterns.

## Design for discovery

[Section titled “Design for discovery”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#design-for-discovery)

The most important part of a skill is its `description`. This is the only
information the model has before activation.

- **Be specific**: Use keywords that are likely to appear in user prompts (for
example, “audit,” “security,” “refactor,” “migration”).
- **Define the trigger**: Clearly state _when_ the skill should be used (for
example, “Use this skill when the user asks to review a PR for performance
regressions”).
- **Avoid overlap**: Ensure your skill descriptions are distinct from one
another and from the general capabilities of the model.

## Progressive disclosure

[Section titled “Progressive disclosure”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#progressive-disclosure)

The “context window” is a shared resource. Use a three-level loading system to
manage context efficiently.

1. **Metadata (name + description)**: Always in context (~100 words).
2. **`SKILL.md` body**: Loaded only after the skill triggers (<5k words).
3. **Bundled resources**: Loaded only as needed by the model.

**Best practice**: Keep the `SKILL.md` body focused on core procedural
instructions. Move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples into
separate files in a `references/` directory.

## Degrees of freedom

[Section titled “Degrees of freedom”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#degrees-of-freedom)

Match the level of instruction specificity to the task’s fragility.

- **High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are
valid or decisions depend heavily on context.
- **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a
preferred pattern exists but some variation is acceptable.
- **Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are
fragile and error-prone, or a specific sequence MUST be followed.

## Bundle resources effectively

[Section titled “Bundle resources effectively”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#bundle-resources-effectively)

Leverage the skill’s ability to include scripts and assets to extend the agent’s
capabilities.

- **Use scripts for deterministic tasks**: If a task can be automated with a
script (for example, running a linter, fetching data from an API), bundle it
in the `scripts/` folder.
- **Agentic ergonomics**: Ensure scripts output LLM-friendly stdout. Suppress
verbose tracebacks and provide clear, concise success/failure messages.
- **Provide templates**: Include common file headers or boilerplate code in the
`assets/` folder to ensure the agent produces consistent output.

## Anatomy of a great skill

[Section titled “Anatomy of a great skill”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#anatomy-of-a-great-skill)

A well-structured skill directory organizes its resources into specialized
sub-folders.

```
my-skill/

├── SKILL.md       (Required) Core instructions and metadata

├── scripts/       (Optional) Executable logic (Node.js, Python, etc.)

├── references/    (Optional) Documentation to be loaded as needed

└── assets/        (Optional) Templates and non-executable resources
```

## Security and privacy

[Section titled “Security and privacy”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills-best-practices/#security-and-privacy)

Design your skills with security in mind to protect your workspace and data.

- **Avoid hardcoded secrets**: Never include API keys or passwords in your
skill’s scripts or documentation.
- **Review third-party skills**: Inspect the `SKILL.md` and scripts of any skill
before installing it from an untrusted source.
- **Limit scope**: Design skills to be as focused as possible to minimize the
potential impact of errors.
