# Use Plan Mode with model steering for complex tasks

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Architecting a complex solution requires precision. By combining Plan Mode’s
structured environment with model steering’s real-time feedback, you can guide
Gemini CLI through the research and design phases to ensure the final
implementation plan is exactly what you need.

## Prerequisites

[Section titled “Prerequisites”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#prerequisites)

- Gemini CLI installed and authenticated.
- [Plan Mode](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/plan-mode) enabled in your settings.
- [Model steering](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/model-steering) enabled in your settings.

## Why combine Plan Mode and model steering?

[Section titled “Why combine Plan Mode and model steering?”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#why-combine-plan-mode-and-model-steering)

[Plan Mode](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/plan-mode) typically follows a linear path: research, propose,
and draft. Adding model steering lets you:

1. **Direct the research:** Correct the agent if it’s looking in the wrong
directory or missing a key dependency.
2. **Iterate mid-draft:** Suggest a different architectural pattern while the
agent is still writing the plan.
3. **Speed up the loop:** Avoid waiting for a full research turn to finish
before providing critical context.

## Step 1: Start a complex task

[Section titled “Step 1: Start a complex task”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#step-1-start-a-complex-task)

Enter Plan Mode and start a task that requires research.

**Prompt:**`/plan I want to implement a new notification service using Redis.`

Gemini CLI enters Plan Mode and starts researching your existing codebase to
identify where the new service should live.

## Step 2: Steer the research phase

[Section titled “Step 2: Steer the research phase”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#step-2-steer-the-research-phase)

As you see the agent calling tools like `list_directory` or `grep_search`, you
might realize it’s missing the relevant context.

**Action:** While the spinner is active, type your hint:
`"Don't forget to check packages/common/queues for the existing Redis config."`

**Result:** Gemini CLI acknowledges your hint and immediately incorporates it
into its research. You’ll see it start exploring the directory you suggested in
its very next turn.

## Step 3: Refine the design mid-turn

[Section titled “Step 3: Refine the design mid-turn”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#step-3-refine-the-design-mid-turn)

After research, the agent starts drafting the implementation plan. If you notice
it’s proposing a design that doesn’t align with your goals, steer it.

**Action:** Type:
`"Actually, let's use a Publisher/Subscriber pattern instead of a simple queue for this service."`

**Result:** The agent stops drafting the current version of the plan,
re-evaluates the design based on your feedback, and starts a new draft that uses
the Pub/Sub pattern.

## Step 4: Approve and implement

[Section titled “Step 4: Approve and implement”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#step-4-approve-and-implement)

Once the agent has used your hints to craft the perfect plan, review the final
`.md` file.

**Action:** Type: `"Looks perfect. Let's start the implementation."`

Gemini CLI exits Plan Mode and transitions to the implementation phase. Because
the plan was refined in real-time with your feedback, the agent can now execute
each step with higher confidence and fewer errors.

## Tips for effective steering

[Section titled “Tips for effective steering”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/tutorials/plan-mode-steering/#tips-for-effective-steering)

- **Be specific:** Instead of “do it differently,” try “use the existing
`Logger` class in `src/utils`.”
- **Steer early:** Providing feedback during the research phase is more
efficient than waiting for the final plan to be drafted.
- **Use for context:** Steering is a great way to provide knowledge that might
not be obvious from reading the code (for example, “We are planning to
deprecate this module next month”).
