# \`gemini gemma\` — Automated Local Model Routing Setup

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Local model routing uses a local Gemma 3 1B model running on your machine to
classify and route user requests. It routes simple requests (like file reads) to
Gemini Flash and complex requests (like architecture discussions) to Gemini Pro.

## What is this?

[Section titled “What is this?”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#what-is-this)

This feature saves cloud API costs by using local inference for task
classification instead of a cloud-based classifier. It adds a few milliseconds
of local latency but can significantly reduce the overall token usage for hosted
models.

## Quick start

[Section titled “Quick start”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#quick-start)

```
# One command does everything: downloads runtime, pulls model, configures settings, starts server

gemini gemma setup
```

You’ll be prompted to accept the Gemma Terms of Use. The model is ~1 GB.

After setup, **just use the CLI normally** — routing happens automatically on
every request.

## Commands

[Section titled “Commands”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#commands)

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `gemini gemma setup` | Full install (binary + model + settings + server start) |
| `gemini gemma status` | Health check — shows what’s installed and running |
| `gemini gemma start` | Start the LiteRT server (auto-starts on CLI launch by default) |
| `gemini gemma stop` | Stop the LiteRT server |
| `gemini gemma logs` | Tail the server logs to see routing requests live |
| `/gemma` | In-session status check (type it inside the CLI) |

## Verifying it works

[Section titled “Verifying it works”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#verifying-it-works)

1. Run `gemini gemma status` — all checks should show green
2. Open two terminals:
   - Terminal 1: `gemini gemma logs` (watch for incoming requests)
   - Terminal 2: use the CLI normally
3. You should see classification requests appear in the logs as you interact
with the CLI
4. The `/gemma` slash command inside a session shows a quick status panel

## Setup flags

[Section titled “Setup flags”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#setup-flags)

```
gemini gemma setup --port 8080      # custom port

gemini gemma setup --no-start       # don't start server after install

gemini gemma setup --force           # re-download everything

gemini gemma setup --skip-model     # binary only, skip the 1GB model download
```

## How it works under the hood

[Section titled “How it works under the hood”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#how-it-works-under-the-hood)

- Local Gemma classifies each request as “simple” or “complex” (~100ms)
- Simple → Flash, Complex → Pro
- If the local server is down, the CLI silently falls back to the cloud
classifier — no errors, no disruption

## Disabling

[Section titled “Disabling”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#disabling)

Set `enabled: false` in settings or just run `gemini gemma stop` to turn off the
server:

```
{ "experimental": { "gemmaModelRouter": { "enabled": false } } }
```

## Advanced setup

[Section titled “Advanced setup”](https://geminicli.com/docs/core/gemma-setup/#advanced-setup)

If you are in an environment where the `gemini gemma setup` command cannot
automatically download binaries (for example, behind a strict corporate
firewall), you can perform the setup manually.
