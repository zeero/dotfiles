# Notifications (experimental)

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Gemini CLI can send system notifications to alert you when a session completes
or when it needs your attention, such as when it’s waiting for you to approve a
tool call.

Notifications are particularly useful when running long-running tasks or using
[Plan Mode](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/plan-mode), letting you switch to other windows while Gemini
CLI works in the background.

## Requirements

[Section titled “Requirements”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/notifications/#requirements)

### Terminal support

[Section titled “Terminal support”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/notifications/#terminal-support)

The CLI uses the OSC 9 terminal escape sequence to trigger system notifications.
This is supported by several modern terminal emulators including iTerm2,
WezTerm, Ghostty, and Kitty. If your terminal does not support OSC 9
notifications, Gemini CLI falls back to a terminal bell (BEL) to get your
attention. Most terminals respond to BEL with a taskbar flash or system alert
sound.

## Enable notifications

[Section titled “Enable notifications”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/notifications/#enable-notifications)

Notifications are disabled by default. You can enable them using the `/settings`
command or by updating your `settings.json` file.

1. Open the settings dialog by typing `/settings` in an interactive session.
2. Navigate to the **General** category.
3. Toggle the **Enable Notifications** setting to **On**.

Alternatively, add the following to your `settings.json`:

```
{

  "general": {

    "enableNotifications": true

  }

}
```

## Types of notifications

[Section titled “Types of notifications”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/notifications/#types-of-notifications)

Gemini CLI sends notifications for the following events:

- **Action required:** Triggered when the model is waiting for user input or
tool approval. This helps you know when the CLI has paused and needs you to
intervene.
- **Session complete:** Triggered when a session finishes successfully. This is
useful for tracking the completion of automated tasks.

## Next steps

[Section titled “Next steps”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/notifications/#next-steps)

- Start planning with [Plan Mode](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/plan-mode).
- Configure your experience with other [settings](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/settings).
