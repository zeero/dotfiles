# Package overview

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

This monorepo contains two main packages: `@google/gemini-cli` and
`@google/gemini-cli-core`.

## `@google/gemini-cli`

[Section titled “@google/gemini-cli”](https://geminicli.com/docs/npm/#googlegemini-cli)

This is the main package for Gemini CLI. It is responsible for the user
interface, command parsing, and all other user-facing functionality.

When this package is published, it is bundled into a single executable file.
This bundle includes all of the package’s dependencies, including
`@google/gemini-cli-core`. This means that whether a user installs the package
with `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` or runs it directly with
`npx @google/gemini-cli`, they are using this single, self-contained executable.

## `@google/gemini-cli-core`

[Section titled “@google/gemini-cli-core”](https://geminicli.com/docs/npm/#googlegemini-cli-core)

This package contains the core logic for interacting with the Gemini API. It is
responsible for making API requests, handling authentication, and managing the
local cache.

This package is not bundled. When it is published, it is published as a standard
Node.js package with its own dependencies. This allows it to be used as a
standalone package in other projects, if needed. All transpiled js code in the
`dist` folder is included in the package.

## NPM workspaces

[Section titled “NPM workspaces”](https://geminicli.com/docs/npm/#npm-workspaces)

This project uses
[NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/workspaces) to manage
the packages within this monorepo. This simplifies development by allowing us to
manage dependencies and run scripts across multiple packages from the root of
the project.

### How it works

[Section titled “How it works”](https://geminicli.com/docs/npm/#how-it-works)

The root `package.json` file defines the workspaces for this project:

```
{

  "workspaces": ["packages/*"]

}
```

This tells NPM that any folder inside the `packages` directory is a separate
package that should be managed as part of the workspace.

### Benefits of workspaces

[Section titled “Benefits of workspaces”](https://geminicli.com/docs/npm/#benefits-of-workspaces)

- **Simplified dependency management**: Running `npm install` from the root of
the project will install all dependencies for all packages in the workspace
and link them together. This means you don’t need to run `npm install` in each
package’s directory.
- **Automatic linking**: Packages within the workspace can depend on each other.
When you run `npm install`, NPM will automatically create symlinks between the
packages. This means that when you make changes to one package, the changes
are immediately available to other packages that depend on it.
- **Simplified script execution**: You can run scripts in any package from the
root of the project using the `--workspace` flag. For example, to run the
`build` script in the `cli` package, you can run
`npm run build --workspace @google/gemini-cli`.
