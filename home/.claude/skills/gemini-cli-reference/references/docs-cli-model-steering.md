# Model steering (experimental)

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Model steering lets you provide real-time guidance and feedback to Gemini CLI
while it is actively executing a task. This lets you correct course, add missing
context, or skip unnecessary steps without having to stop and restart the agent.

Model steering is particularly useful during complex [Plan Mode](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/plan-mode)
workflows or long-running subagent executions where you want to ensure the agent
stays on the right track.

## Enabling model steering

[Section titled “Enabling model steering”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/model-steering/#enabling-model-steering)

Model steering is an experimental feature and is disabled by default. You can
enable it using the `/settings` command or by updating your `settings.json`
file.

1. Type `/settings` in Gemini CLI.
2. Search for **Model Steering**.
3. Set the value to **true**.

Alternatively, add the following to your `settings.json`:

```
{

  "experimental": {

    "modelSteering": true

  }

}
```

## Using model steering

[Section titled “Using model steering”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/model-steering/#using-model-steering)

When model steering is enabled, Gemini CLI treats any text you type while the
agent is working as a steering hint.

1. Start a task (for example, “Refactor the database service”).
2. While the agent is working (the spinner is visible), type your feedback in
the input box.
3. Press **Enter**.

Gemini CLI acknowledges your hint with a brief message and injects it directly
into the model’s context for the very next turn. The model then re-evaluates its
current plan and adjusts its actions accordingly.

### Common use cases

[Section titled “Common use cases”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/model-steering/#common-use-cases)

You can use steering hints to guide the model in several ways:

- **Correcting a path:** “Actually, the utilities are in `src/common/utils`.”
- **Skipping a step:** “Skip the unit tests for now and just focus on the
implementation.”
- **Adding context:** “The `User` type is defined in `packages/core/types.ts`.”
- **Redirecting the effort:** “Stop searching the codebase and start drafting
the plan now.”
- **Handling ambiguity:** “Use the existing `Logger` class instead of creating a
new one.”

## How it works

[Section titled “How it works”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/model-steering/#how-it-works)

When you submit a steering hint, Gemini CLI performs the following actions:

1. **Immediate acknowledgment:** It uses a small, fast model to generate a
one-sentence acknowledgment so you know your hint was received.
2. **Context injection:**It prepends an internal instruction to your hint that
tells the main agent to:

   - Re-evaluate the active plan.
   - Classify the update (for example, as a new task or extra context).
   - Apply minimal-diff changes to affected tasks.
3. **Real-time update:** The hint is delivered to the agent at the beginning of
its next turn, ensuring the most immediate course correction possible.
