# Agent Skills

Copy as MarkdownCopied!

Agent Skills let you extend Gemini CLI with specialized expertise, procedural
workflows, and task-specific resources. Based on the
[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) open standard, a “skill” is a
self-contained directory that packages instructions and assets into a
discoverable capability.

Unlike general context files ( [GEMINI.md](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/gemini-md)), which provide
persistent workspace-wide background, Skills represent **on-demand expertise**.
This lets Gemini CLI maintain a vast library of specialized capabilities—such as
security auditing, cloud deployments, or codebase migrations—without cluttering
the model’s immediate context window.

## How it works

[Section titled “How it works”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#how-it-works)

The lifecycle of an Agent Skill involves discovery, activation, and conditional
resource access.

1. **Discovery**: At the start of a session, Gemini CLI scans the discovery
tiers and injects the name and description of all enabled skills into the
system prompt.
2. **Activation**: When Gemini identifies a task matching a skill’s
description, it calls the `activate_skill` tool.
3. **Consent**: You will see a confirmation prompt in the UI detailing the
skill’s name, purpose, and the directory path it will gain access to.
4. **Injection**: Upon your approval:

   - The `SKILL.md` body and folder structure is added to the conversation
     history.
   - The skill’s directory is added to the agent’s allowed file paths, granting
     it permission to read any bundled assets.
5. **Execution**: The model proceeds with the specialized expertise active. It
is instructed to prioritize the skill’s procedural guidance within reason.

## Discovery tiers

[Section titled “Discovery tiers”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#discovery-tiers)

Gemini CLI discovers skills from several locations, following a specific order
of precedence (lowest to highest):

1. **Built-in skills**: Standard skills included with Gemini CLI that provide
foundational capabilities.
2. **Extension skills**: Skills bundled within installed
[extensions](https://geminicli.com/docs/extensions).
3. **User skills**: Located in `~/.gemini/skills/` or the `~/.agents/skills/`
alias.
4. **Workspace skills**: Located in `.gemini/skills/` or the `.agents/skills/`
alias. Workspace skills are shared with your team via version control.

### Precedence and aliases

[Section titled “Precedence and aliases”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#precedence-and-aliases)

If multiple skills share the same name, the version from the higher-precedence
location is used. Within the same tier (user or workspace), the
`.agents/skills/` alias takes precedence over the `.gemini/skills/` directory.

The `.agents/skills/` alias provides an interoperable path for managing
agent-specific expertise that remains compatible across different AI tools.

## Key benefits

[Section titled “Key benefits”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#key-benefits)

Agent Skills provide several advantages for managing specialized knowledge and
complex workflows.

- **Shared expertise**: Package complex workflows (like a specific team’s PR
review process) into a folder that anyone can use.
- **Repeatable workflows**: Ensure complex multi-step tasks are performed
consistently by providing a procedural framework.
- **Resource bundling**: Include scripts, templates, or example data alongside
instructions so the agent has everything it needs.
- **Progressive disclosure**: Only skill metadata (name and description) is
loaded initially. Detailed instructions and resources are only disclosed when
the model explicitly activates the skill, saving context tokens.

To see all available skills in your current session, use the `/skills list`
command.

## Managing skills

[Section titled “Managing skills”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#managing-skills)

You can manage Agent Skills through interactive session commands or directly
from your terminal.

### In an interactive session

[Section titled “In an interactive session”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#in-an-interactive-session)

Use the `/skills` slash command to view and manage available expertise:

- `/skills list [all] [nodesc]`: Shows discovered skills. Use `all` to include
built-in skills and `nodesc` to hide descriptions.
- `/skills link <path> [--scope user|workspace]`: Links skills from a local
directory.
- `/skills disable <name>`: Prevents a specific skill from being used.
- `/skills enable <name>`: Re-enables a disabled skill.
- `/skills reload` (or `/skills refresh`): Refreshes the list of discovered
skills from all tiers.

### From the terminal

[Section titled “From the terminal”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#from-the-terminal)

The `gemini skills` command provides management utilities:

```
# List all discovered skills. Use --all to include built-in skills.

gemini skills list --all

# Install a skill from a Git repository or local directory.

# Use --consent to skip the security confirmation prompt.

gemini skills install https://github.com/user/repo.git --consent

# Uninstall a skill.

gemini skills uninstall my-skill --scope workspace
```

#### Command options

[Section titled “Command options”](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/#command-options)

The skill management commands support several global and command-specific
options.

- `--scope`: Either `user` (global, default) or `workspace` (local to the
project).
- `--path`: The sub-directory within a Git repository containing the skill.
- `--consent`: Acknowledge security risks and skip the interactive confirmation
during installation.

[CLI reference](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/cli-reference#skills-management).
