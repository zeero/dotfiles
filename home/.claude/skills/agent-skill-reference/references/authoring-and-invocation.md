### Add supporting files

Skills can include multiple files in their directory. This keeps `SKILL.md` focused on the essentials while letting Claude access detailed reference material only when needed. Large reference docs, API specifications, or example collections don’t need to load into context every time the skill runs.

```text
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required - overview and navigation)
├── reference.md (detailed API docs - loaded when needed)
├── examples.md (usage examples - loaded when needed)
└── scripts/
    └── helper.py (utility script - executed, not loaded)
```

Reference supporting files from `SKILL.md` so Claude knows what each file contains and when to load it:

```markdown
## Additional resources

- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
```

Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

### Control who invokes a skill

By default, both you and Claude can invoke any skill. You can type `/skill-name` to invoke it directly, and Claude can load it automatically when relevant to your conversation. Two frontmatter fields let you restrict this:

- **`disable-model-invocation: true`**: Only you can invoke the skill. Use this for workflows with side effects or that you want to control timing, like `/commit`, `/deploy`, or `/send-slack-message`. You don’t want Claude deciding to deploy because your code looks ready.
- **`user-invocable: false`**: Only Claude can invoke the skill. Use this for background knowledge that isn’t actionable as a command. A `legacy-system-context` skill explains how an old system works. Claude should know this when relevant, but `/legacy-system-context` isn’t a meaningful action for users to take.

This example creates a deploy skill that only you can trigger. The `disable-model-invocation: true` field prevents Claude from running it automatically:

```yaml
---
name: deploy
description: Deploy the application to production
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Deploy $ARGUMENTS to production:

1. Run the test suite
2. Build the application
3. Push to the deployment target
4. Verify the deployment succeeded
```

Here’s how the two fields affect invocation and context loading:

| Frontmatter | You can invoke | Claude can invoke | When loaded into context |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (default) | Yes | Yes | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No | Description not in context, full skill loads when you invoke |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes | Description always in context, full skill loads when invoked |

In a regular session, skill descriptions are loaded into context so Claude knows what’s available, but full skill content only loads when invoked. [Subagents with preloaded skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#preload-skills-into-subagents) work differently: the full skill content is injected at startup.

### Skill content lifecycle

When you or Claude invoke a skill, the rendered `SKILL.md` content enters the conversation as a single message and stays there for the rest of the session. Claude Code does not re-read the skill file on later turns, so write guidance that should apply throughout a task as standing instructions rather than one-time steps.

[Auto-compaction](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/how-claude-code-works#when-context-fills-up) carries invoked skills forward within a token budget. When the conversation is summarized to free context, Claude Code re-attaches the most recent invocation of each skill after the summary, keeping the first 5,000 tokens of each. Re-attached skills share a combined budget of 25,000 tokens. Claude Code fills this budget starting from the most recently invoked skill, so older skills can be dropped entirely after compaction if you have invoked many in one session.

If a skill seems to stop influencing behavior after the first response, the content is usually still present and the model is choosing other tools or approaches. Strengthen the skill’s `description` and instructions so the model keeps preferring it, or use [hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) to enforce behavior deterministically. If the skill is large or you invoked several others after it, re-invoke it after compaction to restore the full content.

### Pre-approve tools for a skill

The `allowed-tools` field grants permission for the listed tools while the skill is active, so Claude can use them without prompting you for approval. It does not restrict which tools are available: every tool remains callable, and your [permission settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions) still govern tools that are not listed.

For skills checked into a project’s `.claude/skills/` directory, `allowed-tools` takes effect after you accept the workspace trust dialog for that folder, the same as permission rules in `.claude/settings.json`. Review project skills before trusting a repository, since a skill can grant itself broad tool access.

This skill lets Claude run git commands without per-use approval whenever you invoke it:

```yaml
---
name: commit
description: Stage and commit the current changes
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Bash(git add *) Bash(git commit *) Bash(git status *)
---
```

To remove tools from Claude’s available pool while a skill is active, list them in `disallowed-tools` in the skill’s frontmatter. The restriction clears when you send your next message. To block tools across all skills and prompts, add deny rules in your [permission settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions).

### Pass arguments to skills

Both you and Claude can pass arguments when invoking a skill. Arguments are available via the `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder.

This skill fixes a GitHub issue by number. The `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder gets replaced with whatever follows the skill name:

```yaml
---
name: fix-issue
description: Fix a GitHub issue
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Fix GitHub issue $ARGUMENTS following our coding standards.

1. Read the issue description
2. Understand the requirements
3. Implement the fix
4. Write tests
5. Create a commit
```

When you run `/fix-issue 123`, Claude receives “Fix GitHub issue 123 following our coding standards…”

If you invoke a skill with arguments but the skill doesn’t include `$ARGUMENTS`, Claude Code appends `ARGUMENTS: <your input>` to the end of the skill content so Claude still sees what you typed.

To access individual arguments by position, use `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or the shorter `$N`:

```yaml
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $ARGUMENTS[0] component from $ARGUMENTS[1] to $ARGUMENTS[2].
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```

Running `/migrate-component SearchBar React Vue` replaces `$ARGUMENTS[0]` with `SearchBar`, `$ARGUMENTS[1]` with `React`, and `$ARGUMENTS[2]` with `Vue`. The same skill using the `$N` shorthand:

```yaml
---
name: migrate-component
description: Migrate a component from one framework to another
---

Migrate the $0 component from $1 to $2.
Preserve all existing behavior and tests.
```
