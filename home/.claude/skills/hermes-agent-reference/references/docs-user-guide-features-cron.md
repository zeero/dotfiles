Schedule tasks to run automatically with natural language or cron expressions. Hermes exposes cron management through a single `cronjob` tool with action-style operations instead of separate schedule/list/remove tools.

## What cron can do now [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#what-cron-can-do-now "Direct link to What cron can do now")

Cron jobs can:

- schedule one-shot or recurring tasks
- pause, resume, edit, trigger, and remove jobs
- attach zero, one, or multiple skills to a job
- deliver results back to the origin chat, local files, or configured platform targets
- run in fresh agent sessions with the normal static tool list
- run in **no-agent mode** — a script on a schedule, its stdout delivered verbatim, zero LLM involvement (see the [no-agent mode](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron#no-agent-mode-script-only-jobs) section below)

All of this is available to Hermes itself through the `cronjob` tool, so you can create, pause, edit, and remove jobs by asking in plain language — no CLI required.

warning

Cron-run sessions cannot recursively create more cron jobs. Hermes disables cron management tools inside cron executions to prevent runaway scheduling loops.

## Creating scheduled tasks [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#creating-scheduled-tasks "Direct link to Creating scheduled tasks")

### In chat with `/cron` [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#in-chat-with-cron "Direct link to in-chat-with-cron")

```bash
/cron add 30m "Remind me to check the build"
/cron add "every 2h" "Check server status"
/cron add "every 1h" "Summarize new feed items" --skill blogwatcher
/cron add "every 1h" "Use both skills and combine the result" --skill blogwatcher --skill maps
```

### From the standalone CLI [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#from-the-standalone-cli "Direct link to From the standalone CLI")

```bash
hermes cron create "every 2h" "Check server status"
hermes cron create "every 1h" "Summarize new feed items" --skill blogwatcher
hermes cron create "every 1h" "Use both skills and combine the result" \
  --skill blogwatcher \
  --skill maps \
  --name "Skill combo"
```

### Through natural conversation [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#through-natural-conversation "Direct link to Through natural conversation")

Ask Hermes normally:

```text
Every morning at 9am, check Hacker News for AI news and send me a summary on Telegram.
```

Hermes will use the unified `cronjob` tool internally.

## Skill-backed cron jobs [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#skill-backed-cron-jobs "Direct link to Skill-backed cron jobs")

A cron job can load one or more skills before it runs the prompt.

### Single skill [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#single-skill "Direct link to Single skill")

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    skill="blogwatcher",
    prompt="Check the configured feeds and summarize anything new.",
    schedule="0 9 * * *",
    name="Morning feeds",
)
```

### Multiple skills [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#multiple-skills "Direct link to Multiple skills")

Skills are loaded in order. The prompt becomes the task instruction layered on top of those skills.

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    skills=["blogwatcher", "maps"],
    prompt="Look for new local events and interesting nearby places, then combine them into one short brief.",
    schedule="every 6h",
    name="Local brief",
)
```

This is useful when you want a scheduled agent to inherit reusable workflows without stuffing the full skill text into the cron prompt itself.

## Running a job inside a project directory [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#running-a-job-inside-a-project-directory "Direct link to Running a job inside a project directory")

Cron jobs default to running detached from any repo — no `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `.cursorrules` is loaded, and the terminal / file / code-exec tools run from whatever working directory the gateway started in. Pass `--workdir` (CLI) or `workdir=` (tool call) to change that:

```bash
# Standalone CLI (schedule and prompt are positional)
hermes cron create "every 1d at 09:00" \
  "Audit open PRs, summarize CI health, and post to #eng" \
  --workdir /home/me/projects/acme
```

```python
# From a chat, via the cronjob tool
cronjob(
    action="create",
    schedule="every 1d at 09:00",
    workdir="/home/me/projects/acme",
    prompt="Audit open PRs, summarize CI health, and post to #eng",
)
```

When `workdir` is set:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.cursorrules` from that directory are injected into the system prompt (same discovery order as the interactive CLI)
- `terminal`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `patch`, `search_files`, and `execute_code` all use that directory as their working directory (via `TERMINAL_CWD`)
- The path must be an absolute directory that exists — relative paths and missing directories are rejected at create / update time
- Pass `--workdir ""` (or `workdir=""` via the tool) on edit to clear it and restore the old behaviour

Serialization

Jobs with a `workdir` run sequentially on the scheduler tick, not in the parallel pool. This is deliberate — `TERMINAL_CWD` is process-global, so two workdir jobs running at the same time would corrupt each other's cwd. Workdir-less jobs still run in parallel as before.

## Running cron jobs in a specific profile [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#running-cron-jobs-in-a-specific-profile "Direct link to Running cron jobs in a specific profile")

By default a cron job inherits whichever Hermes profile owned the gateway / CLI that created it. Pass `--profile <name>` (CLI) or `profile=` (cronjob tool) to re-target the job at a different profile — the scheduler resolves that profile's `HERMES_HOME`, temporarily switches into it for the duration of the run, loads its `.env` \+ `config.yaml`, and executes the job there:

```bash
# Pin a job to the `night-ops` profile regardless of where it was scheduled
hermes cron create "every 1d at 03:00" \
  "Tail the security log and flag anomalies" \
  --profile night-ops
```

```python
# From a chat, via the cronjob tool
cronjob(
    action="create",
    schedule="every 1d at 03:00",
    prompt="Tail the security log and flag anomalies",
    profile="night-ops",
)
```

Use `--profile default` to explicitly pin to the root Hermes profile. The named profile must already exist; the scheduler refuses to create profiles on the fly. To clear a profile pin during `cron edit`, pass an empty string (`--profile ""` or `profile=""`) — the job reverts to running in whatever profile the scheduler itself is in.

If the pinned profile is later deleted, the scheduler logs a warning and falls back to running the job in its current profile rather than crashing — so a stale `profile` reference never wedges a job.

Serialization

Jobs with a `profile` set also run sequentially, for the same reason as `workdir`-pinned jobs: switching `HERMES_HOME` is a process-global mutation, so two profile-pinned jobs running in parallel would race each other. Unpinned jobs still run in the normal parallel pool.

## Editing jobs [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#editing-jobs "Direct link to Editing jobs")

You do not need to delete and recreate jobs just to change them.

Job reference

The `<job_id>` placeholder below (and in [Lifecycle actions](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron#lifecycle-actions)) also accepts the job's name (case-insensitive) — handy when you remember `morning-digest` but not the hex ID. An exact job ID takes precedence over name matches; if the reference is not an ID and a name matches more than one job, the command refuses and prints the candidate IDs so you can disambiguate.

### Chat [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#chat "Direct link to Chat")

```bash
/cron edit <job_id> --schedule "every 4h"
/cron edit <job_id> --prompt "Use the revised task"
/cron edit <job_id> --skill blogwatcher --skill maps
/cron edit <job_id> --remove-skill blogwatcher
/cron edit <job_id> --clear-skills
```

### Standalone CLI [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#standalone-cli "Direct link to Standalone CLI")

```bash
hermes cron edit <job_id> --schedule "every 4h"
hermes cron edit <job_id> --prompt "Use the revised task"
hermes cron edit <job_id> --skill blogwatcher --skill maps
hermes cron edit <job_id> --add-skill maps
hermes cron edit <job_id> --remove-skill blogwatcher
hermes cron edit <job_id> --clear-skills
```

Notes:

- repeated `--skill` replaces the job's attached skill list
- `--add-skill` appends to the existing list without replacing it
- `--remove-skill` removes specific attached skills
- `--clear-skills` removes all attached skills

## Lifecycle actions [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#lifecycle-actions "Direct link to Lifecycle actions")

Cron jobs now have a fuller lifecycle than just create/remove.

### Chat [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#chat-1 "Direct link to Chat")

```bash
/cron list
/cron pause <job_id>
/cron resume <job_id>
/cron run <job_id>
/cron remove <job_id>
```

### Standalone CLI [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#standalone-cli-1 "Direct link to Standalone CLI")

```bash
hermes cron list
hermes cron pause <job_id>
hermes cron resume <job_id>
hermes cron run <job_id>
hermes cron remove <job_id>
hermes cron status
hermes cron tick
```

What they do:

- `pause` — keep the job but stop scheduling it
- `resume` — re-enable the job and compute the next future run
- `run` — trigger the job on the next scheduler tick
- `remove` — delete it entirely

## How it works [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

**Cron execution is handled by the gateway daemon.** The gateway ticks the scheduler every 60 seconds, running any due jobs in isolated agent sessions.

```bash
hermes gateway install     # Install as a user service
sudo hermes gateway install --system   # Linux: boot-time system service for servers
hermes gateway             # Or run in foreground

hermes cron list
hermes cron status
```

### Gateway scheduler behavior [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#gateway-scheduler-behavior "Direct link to Gateway scheduler behavior")

On each tick Hermes:

1. loads jobs from `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`
2. checks `next_run_at` against the current time
3. starts a fresh `AIAgent` session for each due job
4. optionally injects one or more attached skills into that fresh session
5. runs the prompt to completion
6. delivers the final response
7. updates run metadata and the next scheduled time

A file lock at `~/.hermes/cron/.tick.lock` prevents overlapping scheduler ticks from double-running the same job batch.

## Delivery options [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#delivery-options "Direct link to Delivery options")

When scheduling jobs, you specify where the output goes:

| Option | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"origin"` | Back to where the job was created | Default on messaging platforms |
| `"local"` | Save to local files only (`~/.hermes/cron/output/`) | Default on CLI |
| `"telegram"` | Telegram home channel | Uses `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL` |
| `"telegram:123456"` | Specific Telegram chat by ID | Direct delivery |
| `"telegram:-100123:17585"` | Specific Telegram topic | `chat_id:thread_id` format |
| `"discord"` | Discord home channel | Uses `DISCORD_HOME_CHANNEL` |
| `"discord:#engineering"` | Specific Discord channel | By channel name |
| `"slack"` | Slack home channel |  |
| `"whatsapp"` | WhatsApp home |  |
| `"signal"` | Signal |  |
| `"matrix"` | Matrix home room |  |
| `"mattermost"` | Mattermost home channel |  |
| `"email"` | Email |  |
| `"sms"` | SMS via Twilio |  |
| `"homeassistant"` | Home Assistant |  |
| `"dingtalk"` | DingTalk |  |
| `"feishu"` | Feishu/Lark |  |
| `"wecom"` | WeCom |  |
| `"weixin"` | Weixin (WeChat) |  |
| `"bluebubbles"` | BlueBubbles (iMessage) |  |
| `"qqbot"` | QQ Bot (Tencent QQ) |  |
| `"all"` | Fan out to every connected home channel | Resolved at fire time |
| `"telegram,discord"` | Fan out to a specific set of channels | Comma-separated list |
| `"origin,all"` | Deliver to the origin **plus** every other connected channel | Combine any tokens |

The agent's final response is automatically delivered. You do not need to call `send_message` in the cron prompt.

### Routing intent (`all`) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#routing-intent-all "Direct link to routing-intent-all")

`all` lets you ship one cron job to every messaging channel you have configured, without having to enumerate them by name. It is **resolved at fire time**, so a job created before you wired up Telegram will pick up Telegram on the next tick after you set `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL`.

Semantics: `all` expands to every platform with a configured home channel. Zero is fine; the job simply produces no delivery targets and is recorded as a delivery failure upstream.

`all` composes with explicit targets. `origin,all` delivers to the origin chat _plus_ every other connected home channel, de-duplicating by `(platform, chat_id, thread_id)`.

### Telegram cron topic (`TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID`) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#telegram-cron-topic-telegram_cron_thread_id "Direct link to telegram-cron-topic-telegram_cron_thread_id")

When Telegram topic mode is enabled, the root DM is reserved as a system lobby — replies sent there are rebuffed with a lobby reminder and `reply_to_message_id` is dropped, so you cannot reply to a cron message that landed in the main chat.

Point cron at a dedicated forum topic instead:

1. In Telegram, open the bot DM and create a topic named e.g. `Cron`. Long-press the topic header → **Copy link**; the trailing integer is the topic's `message_thread_id`.
2. Set `TELEGRAM_CRON_THREAD_ID=<that id>` in your `.env`.

This applies only to cron deliveries. `TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL_THREAD_ID` (used elsewhere, e.g. restart notifications) is unchanged. Explicit `deliver="telegram:chat_id:thread_id"` targets continue to win over the env var. Replies to cron messages now arrive in the existing topic session, so you can act on them directly.

### Response wrapping [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#response-wrapping "Direct link to Response wrapping")

By default, delivered cron output is wrapped with a header and footer so the recipient knows it came from a scheduled task:

```text
Cronjob Response: Morning feeds
-------------

<agent output here>

Note: The agent cannot see this message, and therefore cannot respond to it.
```

To deliver the raw agent output without the wrapper, set `cron.wrap_response` to `false`:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
cron:
  wrap_response: false
```

### Silent suppression [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#silent-suppression "Direct link to Silent suppression")

If the agent's final response starts with `[SILENT]`, delivery is suppressed entirely. The output is still saved locally for audit (in `~/.hermes/cron/output/`), but no message is sent to the delivery target.

This is useful for monitoring jobs that should only report when something is wrong:

```text
Check if nginx is running. If everything is healthy, respond with only [SILENT].
Otherwise, report the issue.
```

Failed jobs always deliver regardless of the `[SILENT]` marker — only successful runs can be silenced.

## Script timeout [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#script-timeout "Direct link to Script timeout")

Pre-run scripts (attached via the `script` parameter) have a default timeout of 120 seconds. If your scripts need longer — for example, to include randomized delays that avoid bot-like timing patterns — you can increase this:

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
cron:
  script_timeout_seconds: 300   # 5 minutes
```

Or set the `HERMES_CRON_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT` environment variable. The resolution order is: env var → config.yaml → 120s default.

## No-agent mode (script-only jobs) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#no-agent-mode-script-only-jobs "Direct link to No-agent mode (script-only jobs)")

For recurring jobs that don't need LLM reasoning — classic watchdogs, disk/memory alerts, heartbeats, CI pings — pass `no_agent=True` at creation time. The scheduler runs your script on schedule and delivers its stdout directly, skipping the agent entirely:

```bash
hermes cron create "every 5m" \
  --no-agent \
  --script memory-watchdog.sh \
  --deliver telegram \
  --name "memory-watchdog"
```

Semantics:

- Script stdout (trimmed) → delivered verbatim as the message.
- **Empty stdout → silent tick**, no delivery. This is the watchdog pattern: "only say something when something is wrong".
- Non-zero exit or timeout → an error alert is delivered, so a broken watchdog can't fail silently.
- `{"wakeAgent": false}` on the last line → silent tick (same gate LLM jobs use).
- No tokens, no model, no provider fallback — the job never touches the inference layer.

`.sh` / `.bash` files run under `/bin/bash`; anything else under the current Python interpreter (`sys.executable`). Scripts must live in `~/.hermes/scripts/` (same sandboxing rule as the pre-run script gate).

### The agent sets these up for you [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#the-agent-sets-these-up-for-you "Direct link to The agent sets these up for you")

The `cronjob` tool's schema exposes `no_agent` to Hermes directly, so you can describe a watchdog in chat and let the agent wire it up:

```text
Ping me on Telegram if RAM is over 85%, every 5 minutes.
```

Hermes will write the check script to `~/.hermes/scripts/` via `write_file`, then call:

```python
cronjob(action="create", schedule="every 5m",
        script="memory-watchdog.sh", no_agent=True,
        deliver="telegram", name="memory-watchdog")
```

It picks `no_agent=True` automatically when the message content is fully determined by the script (watchdogs, threshold alerts, heartbeats). The same tool also lets the agent pause, resume, edit, and remove jobs — so the whole lifecycle is chat-driven without anyone touching the CLI.

See the [Script-Only Cron Jobs guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/guides/cron-script-only) for worked examples.

## Chaining jobs with `context_from` [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#chaining-jobs-with-context_from "Direct link to chaining-jobs-with-context_from")

Cron jobs run in isolated sessions with no memory of previous runs. But sometimes one job's output is exactly what the next job needs. The `context_from` parameter wires that connection automatically — Job B's prompt gets Job A's most recent output prepended as context at runtime.

```python
# Job 1: Collect raw data
cronjob(
    action="create",
    prompt="Fetch the top 10 AI/ML stories from Hacker News. Save them to ~/.hermes/data/briefs/raw.md in markdown format with title, URL, and score.",
    schedule="0 7 * * *",
    name="AI News Collector",
)

# Job 2: Triage — receives Job 1's output as context
# Get Job 1's ID from: cronjob(action="list")
cronjob(
    action="create",
    prompt="Read ~/.hermes/data/briefs/raw.md. Score each story 1–10 for engagement potential and novelty. Output the top 5 to ~/.hermes/data/briefs/ranked.md.",
    schedule="30 7 * * *",
    context_from="<job1_id>",
    name="AI News Triage",
)

# Job 3: Ship — receives Job 2's output as context
cronjob(
    action="create",
    prompt="Read ~/.hermes/data/briefs/ranked.md. Write 3 tweet drafts (hook + body + hashtags). Deliver to telegram:7976161601.",
    schedule="0 8 * * *",
    context_from="<job2_id>",
    name="AI News Brief",
)
```

**How it works:**

- When Job 2 fires, Hermes reads Job 1's most recent output from `~/.hermes/cron/output/{job1_id}/*.md`
- That output is prepended to Job 2's prompt automatically
- Job 2 doesn't need to hardcode "read this file" — it receives the content as context
- The chain can be any length: Job 1 → Job 2 → Job 3 → ...

**What `context_from` accepts:**

| Format | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Single job ID (string) | `context_from="a1b2c3d4"` |
| Multiple job IDs (list) | `context_from=["job_a", "job_b"]` |

Outputs are concatenated in the order listed.

**When to use it:**

- Multi-stage pipelines (collect → filter → format → deliver)
- Dependent tasks where step N's work depends on step N−1's output
- Fan-out/fan-in patterns where one job aggregates results from several others

## Provider recovery [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#provider-recovery "Direct link to Provider recovery")

Cron jobs inherit your configured fallback providers and credential pool rotation. If the primary API key is rate-limited or the provider returns an error, the cron agent can:

- **Fall back to an alternate provider** if you have `fallback_providers` (or the legacy `fallback_model`) configured in `config.yaml`
- **Rotate to the next credential** in your [credential pool](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration#credential-pool-strategies) for the same provider

This means cron jobs that run at high frequency or during peak hours are more resilient — a single rate-limited key won't fail the entire run.

## Schedule formats [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#schedule-formats "Direct link to Schedule formats")

The agent's final response is automatically delivered — you do **not** need to include `send_message` in the cron prompt for that same destination. If a cron run calls `send_message` to the exact target the scheduler will already deliver to, Hermes skips that duplicate send and tells the model to put the user-facing content in the final response instead. Use `send_message` only for additional or different targets.

### Relative delays (one-shot) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#relative-delays-one-shot "Direct link to Relative delays (one-shot)")

```text
30m     → Run once in 30 minutes
2h      → Run once in 2 hours
1d      → Run once in 1 day
```

### Intervals (recurring) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#intervals-recurring "Direct link to Intervals (recurring)")

```text
every 30m    → Every 30 minutes
every 2h     → Every 2 hours
every 1d     → Every day
```

### Cron expressions [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#cron-expressions "Direct link to Cron expressions")

```text
0 9 * * *       → Daily at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * 1-5     → Weekdays at 9:00 AM
0 */6 * * *     → Every 6 hours
30 8 1 * *      → First of every month at 8:30 AM
0 0 * * 0       → Every Sunday at midnight
```

### ISO timestamps [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#iso-timestamps "Direct link to ISO timestamps")

```text
2026-03-15T09:00:00    → One-time at March 15, 2026 9:00 AM
```

## Repeat behavior [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#repeat-behavior "Direct link to Repeat behavior")

| Schedule type | Default repeat | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One-shot (`30m`, timestamp) | 1 | Runs once |
| Interval (`every 2h`) | forever | Runs until removed |
| Cron expression | forever | Runs until removed |

You can override it:

```python
cronjob(
    action="create",
    prompt="...",
    schedule="every 2h",
    repeat=5,
)
```

## Managing jobs programmatically [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#managing-jobs-programmatically "Direct link to Managing jobs programmatically")

The agent-facing API is one tool:

```python
cronjob(action="create", ...)
cronjob(action="list")
cronjob(action="update", job_id="...")
cronjob(action="pause", job_id="...")
cronjob(action="resume", job_id="...")
cronjob(action="run", job_id="...")
cronjob(action="remove", job_id="...")
```

For `update`, pass `skills=[]` to remove all attached skills.

## Toolsets available to cron jobs [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#toolsets-available-to-cron-jobs "Direct link to Toolsets available to cron jobs")

Cron runs each job in a fresh agent session with no chat platform attached. By default the cron agent gets **the toolset you configured for the `cron` platform in `hermes tools`** — not the CLI default, not everything under the sun.

```bash
hermes tools
# → pick the "cron" platform in the curses UI
# → toggle toolsets on/off just like you would for Telegram/Discord/etc.
```

Tighter per-job control is available via the `enabled_toolsets` field on `cronjob.create` (or on an existing job via `cronjob.update`):

```text
cronjob(action="create", name="weekly-news-summary",
        schedule="every sunday 9am",
        enabled_toolsets=["web", "file"],      # just web + file, no terminal/browser/etc.
        prompt="Summarize this week's AI news: ...")
```

When `enabled_toolsets` is set on a job it wins; otherwise the `hermes tools` cron-platform config wins; otherwise Hermes falls back to the built-in defaults. This matters for cost control: carrying `moa`, `browser`, `delegation` into every tiny "fetch news" job bloats the tool-schema prompt on every LLM call.

### Skipping the agent entirely: `wakeAgent` [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#skipping-the-agent-entirely-wakeagent "Direct link to skipping-the-agent-entirely-wakeagent")

If your cron job attaches a pre-check script (via `script=`), the script can decide at runtime whether Hermes should even invoke the agent. Emit a final stdout line of the form:

```text
{"wakeAgent": false}
```

…and cron skips the agent run entirely for this tick. Useful for frequent polls (every 1–5 min) that only need to wake the LLM when state actually changed — otherwise you pay for zero-content agent turns over and over.

```python
# pre-check script
import json, sys
latest = fetch_latest_issue_count()
prev = read_state("issue_count")
if latest == prev:
    print(json.dumps({"wakeAgent": False}))   # skip this tick
    sys.exit(0)
write_state("issue_count", latest)
print(json.dumps({"wakeAgent": True, "context": {"new_issues": latest - prev}}))
```

When `wakeAgent` is omitted, the default is `true` (wake the agent as usual).

#### Recipes: cheap pre-run gates [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#recipes-cheap-pre-run-gates "Direct link to Recipes: cheap pre-run gates")

The `wakeAgent` gate gives you a $0 way to decide whether a scheduled job should spend any LLM tokens at all. Three patterns cover most use cases.

**File-change gate** — only run when a watched file has new content since the last successful tick. The scheduler records each job's `last_run_at`; compare it against the file's mtime.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.hermes/scripts/feed-changed.sh
FEED="$HOME/data/feed.json"
STATE="$HOME/.hermes/scripts/.feed-changed.last"
test -f "$FEED" || { echo '{"wakeAgent": false}'; exit 0; }
mtime=$(stat -c %Y "$FEED")
last=$(cat "$STATE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
if [ "$mtime" -le "$last" ]; then
  echo '{"wakeAgent": false}'
else
  echo "$mtime" > "$STATE"
  echo '{"wakeAgent": true}'
fi
```

```text
cronjob(action="create", name="process-feed",
        schedule="every 30m",
        script="feed-changed.sh",
        prompt="A new ~/data/feed.json has landed. Summarize what changed.")
```

**External-flag gate** — only run when some other process has signalled readiness (e.g. a deploy hook drops a file, a CI job sets a value in your state store).

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/.hermes/scripts/flag-ready.sh
if test -f /tmp/new-data-ready; then
  rm -f /tmp/new-data-ready
  echo '{"wakeAgent": true}'
else
  echo '{"wakeAgent": false}'
fi
```

```text
cronjob(action="create", name="nightly-analysis",
        schedule="0 9 * * *",
        script="flag-ready.sh",
        prompt="Run the nightly analysis over today's batch.")
```

**SQL-count gate** — only run when there are new rows to process in your own database. The script can also pass the count through to the agent via `context`, so the agent knows how much it's looking at without re-querying.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# ~/.hermes/scripts/new-rows.py
import json, sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("/home/me/data/app.db")
n = conn.execute(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM messages WHERE ts > strftime('%s','now','-2 hours')"
).fetchone()[0]
if n < 1:
    print(json.dumps({"wakeAgent": False}))
else:
    print(json.dumps({"wakeAgent": True, "context": {"new_rows": n}}))
```

```text
cronjob(action="create", name="summarize-new-msgs",
        schedule="every 2h",
        script="new-rows.py",
        prompt="Summarize the new messages from the last 2 hours.")
```

The same pattern works for any data source you can query from a script — Postgres, an HTTP API, your own state store — without baking a SQL evaluator into the cron subsystem.

tip

Hermes's own `~/.hermes/state.db` is an internal schema that changes between releases. Don't query it from a pre-run gate — point at your own database or feed instead.

Credit: this recipe set was prompted by @iankar8's exploration in [#2654](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/2654), which proposed adding sql/file/command triggers as a parallel mechanism. The `script` \+ `wakeAgent` gate already covers all three cases at $0, so the work landed as documentation instead.

### Chaining jobs: `context_from` [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#chaining-jobs-context_from "Direct link to chaining-jobs-context_from")

A cron job can consume the most recent successful output of one or more other jobs by listing their names (or IDs) in `context_from`:

```text
cronjob(action="create", name="daily-digest",
        schedule="every day 7am",
        context_from=["ai-news-fetch", "github-prs-fetch"],
        prompt="Write the daily digest using the outputs above.")
```

The referenced jobs' most recent completed outputs are injected above the prompt as context for this run. Each upstream entry must be a valid job ID or name (see `cronjob action="list"`). Note: chaining reads the _most recent completed_ output — it does not wait for upstream jobs that are running in the same tick.

## Job storage [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#job-storage "Direct link to Job storage")

Jobs are stored in `~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`. Output from job runs is saved to `~/.hermes/cron/output/{job_id}/{timestamp}.md`.

Jobs may store `model` and `provider` as `null`. When those fields are omitted, Hermes resolves them at execution time from the global configuration. They only appear in the job record when a per-job override is set.

The storage uses atomic file writes so interrupted writes do not leave a partially written job file behind.

## Self-contained prompts still matter [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#self-contained-prompts-still-matter "Direct link to Self-contained prompts still matter")

Important

Cron jobs run in a completely fresh agent session. The prompt must contain everything the agent needs that is not already provided by attached skills.

**BAD:**`"Check on that server issue"`

**GOOD:**`"SSH into server 192.168.1.100 as user 'deploy', check if nginx is running with 'systemctl status nginx', and verify https://example.com returns HTTP 200."`

## Security [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/cron\#security "Direct link to Security")

Scheduled task prompts are scanned for prompt-injection and credential-exfiltration patterns at creation and update time. Prompts containing invisible Unicode tricks, SSH backdoor attempts, or obvious secret-exfiltration payloads are blocked.
