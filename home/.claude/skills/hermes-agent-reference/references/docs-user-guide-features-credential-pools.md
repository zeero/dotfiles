Credential pools let you register multiple API keys or OAuth tokens for the same provider. When one key hits a rate limit or billing quota, Hermes automatically rotates to the next healthy key — keeping your session alive without switching providers.

This is different from [fallback providers](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/fallback-providers), which switch to a _different_ provider entirely. Credential pools are same-provider rotation; fallback providers are cross-provider failover. Pools are tried first — if all pool keys are exhausted, _then_ the fallback provider activates.

## How It Works [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

```text
Your request
  → Pick key from pool (round_robin / least_used / fill_first / random)
  → Send to provider
  → 429 rate limit?
      → Retry same key once (transient blip)
      → Second 429 → rotate to next pool key
      → All keys exhausted → fallback_model (different provider)
  → 402 billing error?
      → Immediately rotate to next pool key (24h cooldown)
  → 401 auth expired?
      → Try refreshing the token (OAuth)
      → Refresh failed → rotate to next pool key
  → Success → continue normally
```

## Quick Start [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")

If you already have an API key set in `.env`, Hermes auto-discovers it as a 1-key pool. To benefit from pooling, add more keys:

```bash
# Add a second OpenRouter key
hermes auth add openrouter --api-key sk-or-v1-your-second-key

# Add a second Anthropic key
hermes auth add anthropic --type api-key --api-key sk-ant-api03-your-second-key

# Add an Anthropic OAuth credential (requires Claude Max plan + extra usage credits)
hermes auth add anthropic --type oauth
# Opens browser for OAuth login
```

Check your pools:

```bash
hermes auth list
```

Output:

```text
openrouter (2 credentials):
  #1  OPENROUTER_API_KEY   api_key env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY ←
  #2  backup-key           api_key manual

anthropic (3 credentials):
  #1  hermes_pkce          oauth   hermes_pkce ←
  #2  claude_code          oauth   claude_code
  #3  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY    api_key env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

The `←` marks the currently selected credential.

## Interactive Management [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#interactive-management "Direct link to Interactive Management")

Run `hermes auth` with no subcommand for an interactive wizard:

```bash
hermes auth
```

This shows your full pool status and offers a menu:

```text
What would you like to do?
  1. Add a credential
  2. Remove a credential
  3. Reset cooldowns for a provider
  4. Set rotation strategy for a provider
  5. Exit
```

For providers that support both API keys and OAuth (Anthropic, Nous, Codex), the add flow asks which type:

```text
anthropic supports both API keys and OAuth login.
  1. API key (paste a key from the provider dashboard)
  2. OAuth login (authenticate via browser)
Type [1/2]:
```

## CLI Commands [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#cli-commands "Direct link to CLI Commands")

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hermes auth` | Interactive pool management wizard |
| `hermes auth list` | Show all pools and credentials |
| `hermes auth list <provider>` | Show a specific provider's pool |
| `hermes auth add <provider>` | Add a credential (prompts for type and key) |
| `hermes auth add <provider> --type api-key --api-key <key>` | Add an API key non-interactively |
| `hermes auth add <provider> --type oauth` | Add an OAuth credential via browser login |
| `hermes auth remove <provider> <index>` | Remove credential by 1-based index |
| `hermes auth reset <provider>` | Clear all cooldowns/exhaustion status |

## Rotation Strategies [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#rotation-strategies "Direct link to Rotation Strategies")

Configure via `hermes auth` → "Set rotation strategy" or in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
credential_pool_strategies:
  openrouter: round_robin
  anthropic: least_used
```

| Strategy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `fill_first` (default) | Use the first healthy key until it's exhausted, then move to the next |
| `round_robin` | Cycle through keys evenly, rotating after each selection |
| `least_used` | Always pick the key with the lowest request count |
| `random` | Random selection among healthy keys |

## Error Recovery [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#error-recovery "Direct link to Error Recovery")

The pool handles different errors differently:

| Error | Behavior | Cooldown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **429 Rate Limit** | Retry same key once (transient). Second consecutive 429 rotates to next key | 1 hour |
| **402 Billing/Quota** | Immediately rotate to next key | 24 hours |
| **401 Auth Expired** | Try refreshing the OAuth token first. Rotate only if refresh fails | — |
| **All keys exhausted** | Fall through to `fallback_model` if configured | — |

The `has_retried_429` flag resets on every successful API call, so a single transient 429 doesn't trigger rotation.

## Custom Endpoint Pools [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#custom-endpoint-pools "Direct link to Custom Endpoint Pools")

Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (Together.ai, RunPod, local servers) get their own pools, keyed by the endpoint name from `custom_providers` in config.yaml.

When you set up a custom endpoint via `hermes model`, it auto-generates a name like "Together.ai" or "Local (localhost:8080)". This name becomes the pool key.

```bash
# After setting up a custom endpoint via hermes model:
hermes auth list
# Shows:
#   Together.ai (1 credential):
#     #1  config key    api_key config:Together.ai ←

# Add a second key for the same endpoint:
hermes auth add Together.ai --api-key sk-together-second-key
```

Custom endpoint pools are stored in `auth.json` under `credential_pool` with a `custom:` prefix:

```json
{
  "credential_pool": {
    "openrouter": [...],
    "custom:together.ai": [...]
  }
}
```

## Auto-Discovery [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#auto-discovery "Direct link to Auto-Discovery")

Hermes automatically discovers credentials from multiple sources and seeds the pool on startup:

| Source | Example | Auto-seeded? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment variables | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes |
| OAuth tokens (auth.json) | Codex device code, Nous device code | Yes |
| Claude Code credentials | `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | Yes (Anthropic) |
| Hermes PKCE OAuth | `~/.hermes/auth.json` | Yes (Anthropic) |
| Custom endpoint config | `model.api_key` in config.yaml | Yes (custom endpoints) |
| Manual entries | Added via `hermes auth add` | Persisted in auth.json |

Auto-seeded entries are updated on each pool load — if you remove an env var, its pool entry is automatically pruned. Manual entries (added via `hermes auth add`) are never auto-pruned.

Borrowed runtime secrets (for example env vars, Bitwarden/Vault/keyring/systemd references, and custom config values) are reference-only at the `auth.json` boundary. Hermes can use the resolved value in memory for the current run, but it persists only metadata such as the source ref, label, status, request counters, and a non-reversible fingerprint. Manual entries and Hermes-owned OAuth/device-code state keep the durable tokens they need to refresh.

## Delegation & Subagent Sharing [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#delegation--subagent-sharing "Direct link to Delegation & Subagent Sharing")

When the agent spawns subagents via `delegate_task`, the parent's credential pool is automatically shared with children:

- **Same provider** — the child receives the parent's full pool, enabling key rotation on rate limits
- **Different provider** — the child loads that provider's own pool (if configured)
- **No pool configured** — the child falls back to the inherited single API key

This means subagents benefit from the same rate-limit resilience as the parent, with no extra configuration needed. Per-task credential leasing ensures children don't conflict with each other when rotating keys concurrently.

## Thread Safety [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#thread-safety "Direct link to Thread Safety")

The credential pool uses a threading lock for all state mutations (`select()`, `mark_exhausted_and_rotate()`, `try_refresh_current()`, `mark_used()`). This ensures safe concurrent access when the gateway handles multiple chat sessions simultaneously.

## Architecture [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#architecture "Direct link to Architecture")

For the full data flow diagram, see [`docs/credential-pool-flow.excalidraw`](https://excalidraw.com/#json=2Ycqhqpi6f12E_3ITyiwh,c7u9jSt5BwrmiVzHGbm87g) in the repository.

The credential pool integrates at the provider resolution layer:

1. **`agent/credential_pool.py`** — Pool manager: storage, selection, rotation, cooldowns
2. **`hermes_cli/auth_commands.py`** — CLI commands and interactive wizard
3. **`hermes_cli/runtime_provider.py`** — Pool-aware credential resolution
4. **`run_agent.py`** — Error recovery: 429/402/401 → pool rotation → fallback

## Storage [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/credential-pools\#storage "Direct link to Storage")

Pool state is stored in `~/.hermes/auth.json` under the `credential_pool` key:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "credential_pool": {
    "openrouter": [\
      {\
        "id": "abc123",\
        "label": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY",\
        "auth_type": "api_key",\
        "priority": 0,\
        "source": "env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY",\
        "secret_source": "bitwarden",\
        "secret_fingerprint": "sha256:12ab34cd56ef7890",\
        "last_status": "ok",\
        "request_count": 142\
      }\
    ],
    "anthropic": [\
      {\
        "id": "manual1",\
        "label": "personal-api-key",\
        "auth_type": "api_key",\
        "priority": 0,\
        "source": "manual",\
        "access_token": "sk-ant-api03-..."\
      }\
    ]
  }
}
```

The OpenRouter entry above was borrowed from an external source, so the raw key is not stored in `auth.json`. The manual Anthropic entry was intentionally added to Hermes' credential store, so its token remains persistable.

Strategies are stored in `config.yaml` (not `auth.json`):

```yaml
credential_pool_strategies:
  openrouter: round_robin
  anthropic: least_used
```
