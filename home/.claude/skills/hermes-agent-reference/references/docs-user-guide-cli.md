Hermes Agent's CLI is a full terminal user interface (TUI) — not a web UI. It features multiline editing, slash-command autocomplete, conversation history, interrupt-and-redirect, and streaming tool output. Built for people who live in the terminal.

tip

Hermes also ships a modern TUI with modal overlays, mouse selection, and non-blocking input. Launch it with `hermes --tui` — see the [TUI](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/tui) guide.

## Running the CLI [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#running-the-cli "Direct link to Running the CLI")

```bash
# Start an interactive session (default)
hermes

# Single query mode (non-interactive)
hermes chat -q "Hello"

# With a specific model
hermes chat --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"

# With a specific provider
hermes chat --provider nous        # Use Nous Portal
hermes chat --provider openrouter  # Force OpenRouter

# With specific toolsets
hermes chat --toolsets "web,terminal,skills"

# Start with one or more skills preloaded
hermes -s hermes-agent-dev,github-auth
hermes chat -s github-pr-workflow -q "open a draft PR"

# Resume previous sessions
hermes --continue             # Resume the most recent CLI session (-c)
hermes --resume <session_id>  # Resume a specific session by ID (-r)

# Verbose mode (debug output)
hermes chat --verbose

# Isolated git worktree (for running multiple agents in parallel)
hermes -w                         # Interactive mode in worktree
hermes -w -q "Fix issue #123"     # Single query in worktree
```

## Interface Layout [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#interface-layout "Direct link to Interface Layout")

![Stylized preview of the Hermes CLI layout showing the banner, conversation area, and fixed input prompt.](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/img/docs/cli-layout.svg)

The Hermes CLI banner, conversation stream, and fixed input prompt rendered as a stable docs figure instead of fragile text art.

The welcome banner shows your model, terminal backend, working directory, available tools, and installed skills at a glance.

### Status Bar [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#status-bar "Direct link to Status Bar")

A persistent status bar sits above the input area, updating in real time:

```text
 ⚕ claude-sonnet-4-20250514 │ 12.4K/200K │ [██████░░░░] 6% │ $0.06 │ 15m
```

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Model name | Current model (truncated if longer than 26 chars) |
| Token count | Context tokens used / max context window |
| Context bar | Visual fill indicator with color-coded thresholds |
| Cost | Estimated session cost (or `n/a` for unknown/zero-priced models) |
| 🗜️ N | **Context compression count** — how many times the running session has been auto-compressed. Appears once the first compression fires. |
| ▶ N | **Active background tasks** — how many `/background` prompts are still running in the current session. Appears whenever at least one task is in flight. |
| Duration | Elapsed session time |
| ⚠ YOLO | **YOLO mode warning** — shown whenever `HERMES_YOLO_MODE` is on (either `hermes --yolo` at launch or `/yolo` toggled mid-session). Mirrors the banner-line warning so you can't forget you're in auto-approve mode. |

The bar adapts to terminal width — full layout at ≥ 76 columns, compact at 52–75, minimal (model + duration, plus the YOLO badge when active) below 52.

**Context color coding:**

| Color | Threshold | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green | < 50% | Plenty of room |
| Yellow | 50–80% | Getting full |
| Orange | 80–95% | Approaching limit |
| Red | ≥ 95% | Near overflow — consider `/compress` |

Use `/usage` for a detailed breakdown including per-category costs (input vs output tokens).

### Session Resume Display [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#session-resume-display "Direct link to Session Resume Display")

When resuming a previous session (`hermes -c` or `hermes --resume <id>`), a "Previous Conversation" panel appears between the banner and the input prompt, showing a compact recap of the conversation history. See [Sessions — Conversation Recap on Resume](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/sessions#conversation-recap-on-resume) for details and configuration.

## Keybindings [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#keybindings "Direct link to Keybindings")

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Alt+Enter`, `Ctrl+J`, or `Shift+Enter` | New line (multi-line input). `Shift+Enter` requires a terminal that distinguishes it from `Enter` — see below. On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is captured by the terminal (fullscreen toggle); use `Ctrl+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` instead. |
| `Alt+V` | Paste an image from the clipboard when supported by the terminal |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste text and opportunistically attach clipboard images |
| `Ctrl+B` | Start/stop voice recording when voice mode is enabled (`voice.record_key`, default: `ctrl+b`) |
| `Ctrl+G` | Open the current input buffer in `$EDITOR` (vim/nvim/nano/VS Code/etc.). Save and quit to send the edited text as the next prompt — ideal for long, multi-paragraph prompts. |
| `Ctrl+X Ctrl+E` | Emacs-style alternate binding for the external editor (same behavior as `Ctrl+G`). |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt agent (double-press within 2s to force exit) |
| `Ctrl+D` | Exit |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Suspend Hermes to background (Unix only). Run `fg` in the shell to resume. |
| `Tab` | Accept auto-suggestion (ghost text) or autocomplete slash commands |

**Multiline paste preview.** When you paste a multi-line block, the CLI echoes a compact single-line preview (`[pasted: 47 lines, 1,842 chars — press Enter to send]`) instead of dumping the whole payload into the scrollback. The full content is still what gets sent; this is just display polish.

**Markdown stripping in final responses.** The CLI strips the most verbose markdown fences and `**bold**` / `*italic*` wrappers from _final_ agent replies so they render as readable terminal prose rather than raw source. Code blocks and lists are preserved. This does not affect gateway platforms or tool results — they keep their markdown for native rendering.

## Slash Commands [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#slash-commands "Direct link to Slash Commands")

Type `/` to see the autocomplete dropdown. Hermes supports a large set of CLI slash commands, dynamic skill commands, and user-defined quick commands.

Common examples:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show command help |
| `/model` | Show or change the current model |
| `/tools` | List currently available tools |
| `/skills browse` | Browse the skills hub and official optional skills |
| `/background <prompt>` | Run a prompt in a separate background session |
| `/skin` | Show or switch the active CLI skin |
| `/voice on` | Enable CLI voice mode (press `Ctrl+B` to record) |
| `/voice tts` | Toggle spoken playback for Hermes replies |
| `/reasoning high` | Increase reasoning effort |
| `/title My Session` | Name the current session |
| `/status` | Show session info — model/profile/tokens/duration — followed by a local **Session recap** block (recent turn counts, top tools used, files touched, latest user prompt + assistant reply). Pure local compute; no LLM call. |
| `/sessions` | Open an interactive session picker right inside the classic CLI (same surface the TUI uses). Type to filter, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to resume. |

For the full built-in CLI and messaging lists, see [Slash Commands Reference](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/reference/slash-commands).

For setup, providers, silence tuning, and messaging/Discord voice usage, see [Voice Mode](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/voice-mode).

tip

Commands are case-insensitive — `/HELP` works the same as `/help`. Installed skills also become slash commands automatically.

## Quick Commands [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#quick-commands "Direct link to Quick Commands")

You can define custom commands that run shell commands instantly without invoking the LLM. These work in both the CLI and messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord, etc.).

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
quick_commands:
  status:
    type: exec
    command: systemctl status hermes-agent
  gpu:
    type: exec
    command: nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,memory.used --format=csv,noheader
  restart:
    type: alias
    target: /gateway restart
```

Then type `/status`, `/gpu`, or `/restart` in any chat. See the [Configuration guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration#quick-commands) for more examples.

## Preloading Skills at Launch [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#preloading-skills-at-launch "Direct link to Preloading Skills at Launch")

If you already know which skills you want active for the session, pass them at launch time:

```bash
hermes -s hermes-agent-dev,github-auth
hermes chat -s github-pr-workflow -s github-auth
```

Hermes loads each named skill into the session prompt before the first turn. The same flag works in interactive mode and single-query mode.

## Skill Slash Commands [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#skill-slash-commands "Direct link to Skill Slash Commands")

Every installed skill in `~/.hermes/skills/` is automatically registered as a slash command. The skill name becomes the command:

```text
/gif-search funny cats
/axolotl help me fine-tune Llama 3 on my dataset
/github-pr-workflow create a PR for the auth refactor

# Just the skill name loads it and lets the agent ask what you need:
/excalidraw
```

## Personalities [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#personalities "Direct link to Personalities")

Set a predefined personality to change the agent's tone:

```text
/personality pirate
/personality kawaii
/personality concise
```

Built-in personalities include: `helpful`, `concise`, `technical`, `creative`, `teacher`, `kawaii`, `catgirl`, `pirate`, `shakespeare`, `surfer`, `noir`, `uwu`, `philosopher`, `hype`.

You can also define custom personalities in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
personalities:
  helpful: "You are a helpful, friendly AI assistant."
  kawaii: "You are a kawaii assistant! Use cute expressions..."
  pirate: "Arrr! Ye be talkin' to Captain Hermes..."
  # Add your own!
```

## Multi-line Input [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#multi-line-input "Direct link to Multi-line Input")

There are two ways to enter multi-line messages:

1. **`Alt+Enter`, `Ctrl+J`, or `Shift+Enter`** — inserts a new line
2. **Backslash continuation** — end a line with `\` to continue:

```text
❯ Write a function that:\
  1. Takes a list of numbers\
  2. Returns the sum
```

info

Pasting multi-line text is supported — use any of the newline keys above, or simply paste content directly.

### Shift+Enter compatibility [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#shiftenter-compatibility "Direct link to Shift+Enter compatibility")

Most terminals send the same byte sequence for `Enter` and `Shift+Enter` by default, so applications cannot distinguish them. Hermes recognises `Shift+Enter` only when the terminal sends a distinct sequence via the [Kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) or xterm's `modifyOtherKeys` mode.

| Terminal | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Kitty, foot, WezTerm, Ghostty | Distinct `Shift+Enter` enabled by default |
| iTerm2 (recent), Alacritty, VS Code terminal, Warp | Supported once the Kitty protocol is enabled in settings |
| Windows Terminal Preview 1.25+ | Supported once the Kitty protocol is enabled in settings |
| macOS Terminal.app, stock Windows Terminal (stable) | Not supported — `Shift+Enter` is indistinguishable from `Enter` |

Where the terminal cannot distinguish them, `Alt+Enter` and `Ctrl+J` continue to work everywhere. **On Windows Terminal specifically, `Alt+Enter` is captured by the terminal (toggles fullscreen) and never reaches Hermes — use `Ctrl+Enter` (delivered as `Ctrl+J`) or `Ctrl+J` directly for a newline.**

## Interrupting the Agent [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#interrupting-the-agent "Direct link to Interrupting the Agent")

You can interrupt the agent at any point:

- **Type a new message + Enter** while the agent is working — it interrupts and processes your new instructions
- **`Ctrl+C`** — interrupt the current operation (press twice within 2s to force exit)
- In-progress terminal commands are killed immediately (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 1s)
- Multiple messages typed during interrupt are combined into one prompt

### Busy Input Mode [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#busy-input-mode "Direct link to Busy Input Mode")

The `display.busy_input_mode` config key controls what happens when you press Enter while the agent is working:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `"interrupt"` (default) | Your message interrupts the current operation and is processed immediately |
| `"queue"` | Your message is silently queued and sent as the next turn after the agent finishes |
| `"steer"` | Your message is injected into the current run via `/steer`, arriving at the agent after the next tool call — no interrupt, no new turn |

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
display:
  busy_input_mode: "steer"   # or "queue" or "interrupt" (default)
```

`"queue"` mode is useful when you want to prepare follow-up messages without accidentally canceling in-flight work. `"steer"` mode is useful when you want to redirect the agent mid-task without interrupting — e.g. "actually, also check the tests" while it's still editing code. Unknown values fall back to `"interrupt"`.

`"steer"` has two automatic fallbacks: if the agent hasn't started yet, or if images are attached, the message falls back to `"queue"` behavior so nothing is lost.

You can also change it inside the CLI:

```text
/busy queue
/busy steer
/busy interrupt
/busy status
```

First-touch hint

The very first time you press Enter while Hermes is working, Hermes prints a one-line reminder explaining the `/busy` knob (`"(tip) Your message interrupted the current run…"`). It only fires once per install — a flag in `config.yaml` under `onboarding.seen.busy_input_prompt` latches it. Delete that key to see the tip again.

### Suspending to Background [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#suspending-to-background "Direct link to Suspending to Background")

On Unix systems, press **`Ctrl+Z`** to suspend Hermes to the background — just like any terminal process. The shell prints a confirmation:

```text
Hermes Agent has been suspended. Run `fg` to bring Hermes Agent back.
```

Type `fg` in your shell to resume the session exactly where you left off. This is not supported on Windows.

## Tool Progress Display [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#tool-progress-display "Direct link to Tool Progress Display")

The CLI shows animated feedback as the agent works:

**Thinking animation** (during API calls):

```text
  ◜ (｡•́︿•̀｡) pondering... (1.2s)
  ◠ (⊙_⊙) contemplating... (2.4s)
  ✧٩(ˊᗜˋ*)و✧ got it! (3.1s)
```

**Tool execution feed:**

```text
  ┊ 💻 terminal `ls -la` (0.3s)
  ┊ 🔍 web_search (1.2s)
  ┊ 📄 web_extract (2.1s)
```

Cycle through display modes with `/verbose`: `off → new → all → verbose`. This command can also be enabled for messaging platforms — see [configuration](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration#display-settings).

### Tool Preview Length [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#tool-preview-length "Direct link to Tool Preview Length")

The `display.tool_preview_length` config key controls the maximum number of characters shown in tool call preview lines (e.g. file paths, terminal commands). The default is `0`, which means no limit — full paths and commands are shown.

```yaml
# ~/.hermes/config.yaml
display:
  tool_preview_length: 80   # Truncate tool previews to 80 chars (0 = no limit)
```

This is useful on narrow terminals or when tool arguments contain very long file paths.

## Session Management [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#session-management "Direct link to Session Management")

### Resuming Sessions [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#resuming-sessions "Direct link to Resuming Sessions")

When you exit a CLI session, a resume command is printed:

```text
Resume this session with:
  hermes --resume 20260225_143052_a1b2c3

Session:        20260225_143052_a1b2c3
Duration:       12m 34s
Messages:       28 (5 user, 18 tool calls)
```

Resume options:

```bash
hermes --continue                          # Resume the most recent CLI session
hermes -c                                  # Short form
hermes -c "my project"                     # Resume a named session (latest in lineage)
hermes --resume 20260225_143052_a1b2c3     # Resume a specific session by ID
hermes --resume "refactoring auth"         # Resume by title
hermes -r 20260225_143052_a1b2c3           # Short form
```

Resuming restores the full conversation history from SQLite. The agent sees all previous messages, tool calls, and responses — just as if you never left.

Use `/title My Session Name` inside a chat to name the current session, or `hermes sessions rename <id> <title>` from the command line. Use `hermes sessions list` to browse past sessions.

### Session Storage [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#session-storage "Direct link to Session Storage")

CLI sessions are stored in Hermes's SQLite state database under `~/.hermes/state.db`. The database keeps:

- session metadata (ID, title, timestamps, token counters)
- message history
- lineage across compressed/resumed sessions
- full-text search indexes used by `session_search`

Some messaging adapters also keep per-platform transcript files alongside the database, but the CLI itself resumes from the SQLite session store.

### Context Compression [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#context-compression "Direct link to Context Compression")

Long conversations are automatically summarized when approaching context limits:

```yaml
# In ~/.hermes/config.yaml
compression:
  enabled: true
  threshold: 0.50    # Compress at 50% of context limit by default

# Summarization model configured under auxiliary:
auxiliary:
  compression:
    model: ""  # Leave empty to use the main chat model (default). Or pin a cheap fast model, e.g. "google/gemini-3-flash-preview".
```

When compression triggers, middle turns are summarized while the first 3 and last 20 turns are always preserved.

## Background Sessions [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#background-sessions "Direct link to Background Sessions")

Run a prompt in a separate background session while continuing to use the CLI for other work:

```text
/background Analyze the logs in /var/log and summarize any errors from today
```

Hermes immediately confirms the task and gives you back the prompt:

```text
🔄 Background task #1 started: "Analyze the logs in /var/log and summarize..."
   Task ID: bg_143022_a1b2c3
```

### How It Works [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

Each `/background` prompt spawns a **completely separate agent session** in a daemon thread:

- **Isolated conversation** — the background agent has no knowledge of your current session's history. It receives only the prompt you provide.
- **Same configuration** — the background agent inherits your model, provider, toolsets, reasoning settings, and fallback model from the current session.
- **Non-blocking** — your foreground session stays fully interactive. You can chat, run commands, or even start more background tasks.
- **Multiple tasks** — you can run several background tasks simultaneously. Each gets a numbered ID.

### Results [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#results "Direct link to Results")

When a background task finishes, the result appears as a panel in your terminal:

```text
╭─ ⚕ Hermes (background #1) ──────────────────────────────────╮
│ Found 3 errors in syslog from today:                         │
│ 1. OOM killer invoked at 03:22 — killed process nginx        │
│ 2. Disk I/O error on /dev/sda1 at 07:15                      │
│ 3. Failed SSH login attempts from 192.168.1.50 at 14:30      │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

If the task fails, you'll see an error notification instead. If `display.bell_on_complete` is enabled in your config, the terminal bell rings when the task finishes.

### Use Cases [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#use-cases "Direct link to Use Cases")

- **Long-running research** — "/background research the latest developments in quantum error correction" while you work on code
- **File processing** — "/background analyze all Python files in this repo and list any security issues" while you continue a conversation
- **Parallel investigations** — start multiple background tasks to explore different angles simultaneously

info

Background sessions do not appear in your main conversation history. They are standalone sessions with their own task ID (e.g., `bg_143022_a1b2c3`).

## Quiet Mode [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/cli\#quiet-mode "Direct link to Quiet Mode")

By default, the CLI runs in quiet mode which:

- Suppresses verbose logging from tools
- Enables kawaii-style animated feedback
- Keeps output clean and user-friendly

For debug output:

```bash
hermes chat --verbose
```
