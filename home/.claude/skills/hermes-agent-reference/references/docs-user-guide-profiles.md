Run multiple independent Hermes agents on the same machine — each with its own config, API keys, memory, sessions, skills, and gateway state.

## What are profiles? [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#what-are-profiles "Direct link to What are profiles?")

A profile is a separate Hermes home directory. Each profile gets its own directory containing its own `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, memories, sessions, skills, cron jobs, and state database. Profiles let you run separate agents for different purposes — a coding assistant, a personal bot, a research agent — without mixing up Hermes state.

When you create a profile, it automatically becomes its own command. Create a profile called `coder` and you immediately have `coder chat`, `coder setup`, `coder gateway start`, etc.

## Quick start [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#quick-start "Direct link to Quick start")

```bash
hermes profile create coder       # creates profile + "coder" command alias
coder setup                       # configure API keys and model
coder chat                        # start chatting
```

That's it. `coder` is now its own Hermes profile with its own config, memory, and state.

## Creating a profile [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#creating-a-profile "Direct link to Creating a profile")

### Blank profile [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#blank-profile "Direct link to Blank profile")

```bash
hermes profile create mybot
```

Creates a fresh profile with bundled skills seeded. Run `mybot setup` to configure API keys, model, and gateway tokens.

If you plan to use this profile as a kanban worker (or want the kanban orchestrator to route work to it), pass `--description "<role>"` at create time so the orchestrator knows what it's good at:

```bash
hermes profile create researcher --description "Reads source code and external docs, writes findings."
```

You can also set or auto-generate the description later with `hermes profile describe` — see the [Kanban guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/kanban#auto-vs-manual-orchestration) for the full routing model.

### Clone config only (`--clone`) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#clone-config-only---clone "Direct link to clone-config-only---clone")

```bash
hermes profile create work --clone
```

Copies your current profile's `config.yaml`, `.env`, and `SOUL.md` into the new profile. Same API keys and model, but fresh sessions and memory. Edit `~/.hermes/profiles/work/.env` for different API keys, or `~/.hermes/profiles/work/SOUL.md` for a different personality.

### Clone everything (`--clone-all`) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#clone-everything---clone-all "Direct link to clone-everything---clone-all")

```bash
hermes profile create backup --clone-all
```

Copies **everything** — config, API keys, personality, all memories, full session history, skills, cron jobs, plugins. A complete snapshot. Useful for backups or forking an agent that already has context.

### Clone from a specific profile [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#clone-from-a-specific-profile "Direct link to Clone from a specific profile")

```bash
hermes profile create work --clone --clone-from coder
```

Honcho memory + profiles

When Honcho is enabled, `--clone` automatically creates a dedicated AI peer for the new profile while sharing the same user workspace. Each profile builds its own observations and identity. See [Honcho -- Multi-agent / Profiles](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory-providers#honcho) for details.

## Using profiles [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#using-profiles "Direct link to Using profiles")

### Command aliases [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#command-aliases "Direct link to Command aliases")

Every profile automatically gets a command alias at `~/.local/bin/<name>`:

```bash
coder chat                    # chat with the coder agent
coder setup                   # configure coder's settings
coder gateway start           # start coder's gateway
coder doctor                  # check coder's health
coder skills list             # list coder's skills
coder config set model.default anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
```

The alias works with every hermes subcommand — it's just `hermes -p <name>` under the hood.

### The `-p` flag [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#the--p-flag "Direct link to the--p-flag")

You can also target a profile explicitly with any command:

```bash
hermes -p coder chat
hermes --profile=coder doctor
hermes chat -p coder -q "hello"    # works in any position
```

### Sticky default (`hermes profile use`) [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#sticky-default-hermes-profile-use "Direct link to sticky-default-hermes-profile-use")

```bash
hermes profile use coder
hermes chat                   # now targets coder
hermes tools                  # configures coder's tools
hermes profile use default    # switch back
```

Sets a default so plain `hermes` commands target that profile. Like `kubectl config use-context`.

### Knowing where you are [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#knowing-where-you-are "Direct link to Knowing where you are")

The CLI always shows which profile is active:

- **Prompt**: `coder ❯` instead of `❯`
- **Banner**: Shows `Profile: coder` on startup
- **`hermes profile`**: Shows current profile name, path, model, gateway status

## Profiles vs workspaces vs sandboxing [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#profiles-vs-workspaces-vs-sandboxing "Direct link to Profiles vs workspaces vs sandboxing")

Profiles are often confused with workspaces or sandboxes, but they are different things:

- A **profile** gives Hermes its own state directory: `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, sessions, memory, logs, cron jobs, and gateway state.
- A **workspace** or **working directory** is where terminal commands start. That is controlled separately by `terminal.cwd`.
- A **sandbox** is what limits filesystem access. Profiles do **not** sandbox the agent.

On the default `local` terminal backend, the agent still has the same filesystem access as your user account. A profile does not stop it from accessing folders outside the profile directory.

If you want a profile to start in a specific project folder, set an explicit absolute `terminal.cwd` in that profile's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
terminal:
  backend: local
  cwd: /absolute/path/to/project
```

Using `cwd: "."` on the local backend means "the directory Hermes was launched from", not "the profile directory".

Also note:

- `SOUL.md` can guide the model, but it does not enforce a workspace boundary.
- Changes to `SOUL.md` take effect cleanly on a new session. Existing sessions may still be using the old prompt state.
- Asking the model "what directory are you in?" is not a reliable isolation test. If you need a predictable starting directory for tools, set `terminal.cwd` explicitly.

## Running gateways [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#running-gateways "Direct link to Running gateways")

Each profile runs its own gateway as a separate process with its own bot token:

```bash
coder gateway start           # starts coder's gateway
assistant gateway start       # starts assistant's gateway (separate process)
```

### Different bot tokens [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#different-bot-tokens "Direct link to Different bot tokens")

Each profile has its own `.env` file. Configure a different Telegram/Discord/Slack bot token in each:

```bash
# Edit coder's tokens
nano ~/.hermes/profiles/coder/.env

# Edit assistant's tokens
nano ~/.hermes/profiles/assistant/.env
```

### Safety: token locks [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#safety-token-locks "Direct link to Safety: token locks")

If two profiles accidentally use the same bot token, the second gateway will be blocked with a clear error naming the conflicting profile. Supported for Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and Signal.

### Persistent services [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#persistent-services "Direct link to Persistent services")

```bash
coder gateway install         # creates hermes-gateway-coder systemd/launchd service
assistant gateway install     # creates hermes-gateway-assistant service
```

Each profile gets its own service name. They run independently.

Inside the official Docker image

Per-profile gateways are supervised by [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) (PID 1 in the container), so `hermes profile create <name>` automatically registers an s6 service slot at `/run/service/gateway-<name>/`. `hermes -p <name> gateway start/stop/restart` dispatches to `s6-svc` instead of spawning a bare process — crashes are auto-restarted and `docker restart` preserves the previously-running set of gateways. See [Per-profile gateway supervision](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/docker#per-profile-gateway-supervision) for details.

## Configuring profiles [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#configuring-profiles "Direct link to Configuring profiles")

Each profile has its own:

- **`config.yaml`** — model, provider, toolsets, all settings
- **`.env`** — API keys, bot tokens
- **`SOUL.md`** — personality and instructions

```bash
coder config set model.default anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
echo "You are a focused coding assistant." > ~/.hermes/profiles/coder/SOUL.md
```

If you want this profile to work in a specific project by default, also set its own `terminal.cwd`:

```bash
coder config set terminal.cwd /absolute/path/to/project
```

## Updating [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#updating "Direct link to Updating")

`hermes update` pulls code once (shared) and syncs new bundled skills to **all** profiles automatically:

```bash
hermes update
# → Code updated (12 commits)
# → Skills synced: default (up to date), coder (+2 new), assistant (+2 new)
```

User-modified skills are never overwritten.

## Managing profiles [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#managing-profiles "Direct link to Managing profiles")

```bash
hermes profile list           # show all profiles with status
hermes profile show coder     # detailed info for one profile
hermes profile rename coder dev-bot   # rename (updates alias + service)
hermes profile export coder   # export to coder.tar.gz
hermes profile import coder.tar.gz   # import from archive
```

## Deleting a profile [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#deleting-a-profile "Direct link to Deleting a profile")

```bash
hermes profile delete coder
```

This stops the gateway, removes the systemd/launchd service, removes the command alias, and deletes all profile data. You'll be asked to type the profile name to confirm.

Use `--yes` to skip confirmation: `hermes profile delete coder --yes`

note

You cannot delete the default profile (`~/.hermes`). To remove everything, use `hermes uninstall`.

## Tab completion [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#tab-completion "Direct link to Tab completion")

```bash
# Bash
eval "$(hermes completion bash)"

# Zsh
eval "$(hermes completion zsh)"
```

Add the line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistent completion. Completes profile names after `-p`, profile subcommands, and top-level commands.

## How it works [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#how-it-works "Direct link to How it works")

Profiles use the `HERMES_HOME` environment variable. When you run `coder chat`, the wrapper script sets `HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes/profiles/coder` before launching hermes. Since 119+ files in the codebase resolve paths via `get_hermes_home()`, Hermes state automatically scopes to the profile's directory — config, sessions, memory, skills, state database, gateway PID, logs, and cron jobs.

This is separate from terminal working directory. Tool execution starts from `terminal.cwd` (or the launch directory when `cwd: "."` on the local backend), not automatically from `HERMES_HOME`.

The default profile is simply `~/.hermes` itself. No migration needed — existing installs work identically.

## Sharing profiles as distributions [​](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles\#sharing-profiles-as-distributions "Direct link to Sharing profiles as distributions")

A profile you built on one machine can be packaged as a **git repository** and installed with one command on another machine — your own workstation, a teammate's laptop, or a community user's environment. The shared package includes the SOUL, config, skills, cron jobs, and MCP connections. Credentials, memories, and sessions stay per-machine.

```bash
# Install a whole agent from a git repo
hermes profile install github.com/you/research-bot --alias

# Update later when the author ships a new version (keeps your memories + .env)
hermes profile update research-bot
```
